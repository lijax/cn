                        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Love our country rationally</h1>
<p>When I entered college, I became interested in reading news about our
country. I only read those positive news, and refused to read negative
ones. If someone showed me dark side of our country, I would naturally
defend or find excuse for it. I also liked to see our people united to
boycott Japanese goods, boycott Carrefour. I hated Japanese, and I even
listened to rap songs from the internet that abuse them. I thought those
were loving our country and I was proud of those actions.</p>
<p>With the increase of my knowledge and well understanding of this world,
I begin to suspect those actions. Are these kinds of things really
loving our country? Yes, but they are all blind loves, blind patriotism.</p>
<p>So what is loving one's country?</p>
<p>Country is just an abstract noun. Loving one's country is essentially
loving the people in this country. If you boycott Japanese goods or
Careefour, yes, those foreign companies will earn less money. Then what
about our people working in those companies? Actually, we need those
companies more than they do to increase our employment. Boycotting them
cannot make us stronger but poorer, just like we boycotting the whole
western world before the reform and opening-up.</p>
<p>If you love your country, you want to do everything you can to make it
better.Criticism is the best motivation to make our country better. It
is the highest level of loving our country. Like human beings, no
country is perfect. From the macro point of view, our country is more
prosperous than it use to be. (You know, 2nd place GDP, Olympics, World
Exposition, Asian Games.) But when it comes to details, there are still
so many problems, (like high house price and inflation, food safety,
forced demolition, judicial injustice, political corruption.) We
shouldn't refuse to accept the flaws of our country. On the contrary, we
should actively discover those flaws so that we can fix them.</p>
<p>(We don't need to criticize other country's same problems as ours's
excuse. I think most of us don't want to criticize other countries, like
America or England, to make them better.)</p>
<p>Narrow nationalism isn't really loving our country. Some people gloated
about Japan's earthquake when it happened. Anyone who is rational would
see that was shameful. Yes, we should'nt forget the history, but it is
for preventing that happen again not for hatred or even revenge. Peoples
are innocent, don't lose our humanity. Belittling others cannot raise
our reputation, it only belittles ourselves.</p>
<p>Blindly following the leader or government's order isn't really loving
one's country. Japanese soldiers in aggression war against us also
thought they love their country. Red guards in culture revolution also
thought they love their country. But they were wrong. Leaders or
governors are humans, they also can be wrong, especially when they are
for their own power and interests. We should use our own mind, humanity,
common sense to judge this.</p>
<p>Blind patriotism can be dangerous. Sometimes it can causes war or
humanitarian catastrophe.</p>
<p>So how to rationally love our country?</p>
<p>To love our country rationally. We should have a well understanding of
our histories, culture, government and society, not only from our point
of view, but also from others outside of our country, to avoid bias and
blind patriotism.</p>
<p>To love our country rationally. We should criticize our government of
inappropriate policies, society's unfairness. Focus on current events.
Concern those intellectuals who always criticize this country and
lawyers who struggle for justice of our society. It is them that really
make our country better.</p>
<p>To love our country rationally. More importantly, use our own mind,
common sense and don't lose our humanity.</p>
